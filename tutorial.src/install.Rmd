Since May 2010, the lavaan package is available on CRAN. Therefore, to
install lavaan, simply start up R, and type:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lavaan", dependencies=TRUE)
```

You can check if the installation was succesful by typing

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
```

When the package is loaded, a startup message will be displayed showing the
version number, and a reminder that this is beta software:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat("This is lavaan ", packageDescription("lavaan", fields="Version"), "\n",
"lavaan is BETA software! Please report any bugs.", sep="")
```

If you see this message, you are ready to start.
