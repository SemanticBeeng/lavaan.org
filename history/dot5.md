#### 0.5 series ####

##### Version 0.5-12 #####

- Released on CRAN: 8 March 2013
- New features and user-visible changes:
  - estfun.lavaan() or lavScores() function computes case-wise scores (first gradient) values
  - better starting values (using an instrumental variables approach) for factor loadings when indicators are categorical
  - full support for categorical variables in simulateData()
- Known issues:
  - factor scores, bootstrapping and theta parameterization are not yet implemented if data is categorical
- Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
  - WLS with multiple groups with small (say, < 50) and unequal sample sizes often fails (non-convergence)
  - fitMeasures(fit, "npar") was not computed correctly if explicit equality constraints (using "==") were used in the model; this affects the computation of AIC and BIC in these cases

##### Version 0.5-11 #####

- Released on CRAN: 19 Dec 2012
- New features and user-visible changes:
  - estimator="PML" is now available if all data is categorical; this is based on work done by Myrsini Katsikatsou
  - simulateData() supports thresholds and creates ordinal data
  - inspect() gains 'WLS.V', 'NACOV', 'cov.lv', 'cor.lv', 'cov.all', and 'cor.all' arguments
  - fitMeasures() spits out many more fit indices: rmr, cn, nnfi, nfi, rfi, ifi, rni, gfi, agfi, pnfi, mfi, ecvi
  - new argument 'sample.cov.rescale' to control if the sample covariance must be internally rescaled (by a factor N-1/N) or not
- Known issues:
  - bootstrapping and theta parameterization are not yet implemented if data is categorical
- Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
  - defined (:=) and constrained (<,>,==) parameters are not standardized if a standardized solution is requested
  - simulateData(): if intercepts are included in the script, and the skewness/kurtosis argument is used, the sign of the intercepts/means is switched
  - if sample.cov is provided, and estimator="WLS" (with a user-provided weight matrix), lavaan complains about the (new) sample.cov.rescale argument not set to a logical
  - if a parameter table is given to the 'start' argument, an error occurs
        in some extreme cases, the starting value for a polyserial correlation fell outside the [-1,1] range, causing an error
  - vnames(partable, type=lv.y/lv.x/ov.y) did not always respect the correct order of the variable names, leading to parameters that were inadvertently set to zero
  - consider the following model syntax: 'y ~ x; z ~~ y': here, y is upgraded to a phantom/dummy latent variable (in the LISREL representation), but z was not upgraded (while it should) if it was not involved in a regression formula

##### Version 0.5-10 #####

- Released on CRAN: 25 Okt 2012
- New features and user-visible changes:
  - modification indices, Rsquare now work if data is categorical
  - changed package mvtnorm to package mnormt, resulting in (slightly) faster
computations of the thresholds and polychoric correlations in some cases
  - predict() gains a newdata argument
  - a user-specified weight matrix can now be provided (using the WLS.V
argument) to be used in estimation when using estimator WLS and friends
  - a user-specified asymptotic variance matrix of the sample statistics can be
provided (using the NACOV argument) to be used when computing robust standard
errors and robust test statistics
  - if a model does not converge, lavaan will not attempt to compute standard errors and a test statistic
  - better handling of multibyte characters in summary() function
        better handling of empty cells in pairwise frequency tables
- Known issues:
  - bootstrapping and theta parameterization are not yet implemented if data is categorical
- Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
  - if the model only contains a single variable, lavaan fails
  - if the model only contains a single categorical variable (eg a probit regression), lavaan fails
  - residual variances that are set to zero during estimation (eg residual variance of composite latent variable), are internally set to 1.0 again in the model matrices after model fitting; this only affects post-fitting operations using the model matrices directly (eg the predict() function)
   - resid(fit, type="standardized") fails if there are any exogenous variables in the model, and if estimator="MLM" or "MLR" is used
   - bootstrapping fails if missing="ml" and the model contains exogenous variables
   - in the categorical case, an internal function (muthen1984) can not handle variables that are of type integer (workaround: coerce them to type numeric)

##### Version 0.5-9 #####

- Released on CRAN: 8 Sept 2012
- New features and user-visible changes:
  - full support for ordinal (and binary) dependent variables using the three stage WLS approach as described in
  - Muth√©n (1984); this implies support for multiple groups (using the delta parameterization), support for a mixture of binary/ordinal/continuous (dependent) variables, and support for exogenous 'fixed.x' covariates
  - new test statistics: mean.var.adjusted (aka the Satterthwaite approach), and scaled.shifted (to mimic the behavior of Mplus 6 and higher)
  - new estimators: MLMV, ULS, ULSM, ULSMV, DWLS, WLSM, WLSMV
  - the 'se' option robust.mlm has been renamed to robust.sem, while robust.mlr has been renamed to robust.huber.white
  - better handling of standard errors if constraints have been used
  - new operator '|' in the syntax: 'u | t1 + t2 + t3' refers to the (three) thresholds of an ordinal variable u with four levels
  - 'u ~*~ u' refers to the scaling parameter (of the delta parameterization) of an ordinal variable u
        'y ~ 1 + x1 + x2' is now legal syntax
  - the convenience function 'measurementInvariance()' has been moved to another package (semTools)
- Known issues:
  - bootstrapping, modification indices, Rsquare and theta parameterization are not yet implemented (if data is categorical)
        some cases will run very slow (in fact slower than 0.5-8), due to the fact that new CRAN policies disallow using .Fortran calls to external packages (eg mvtnorm); therefore, the computation of probabilities under the bivariate standard normal distribution is not vectorized, and hence extremely slow
- Bugs/glitches discovered after the release:
  - if a two-way table contains zeroes, the computation of the polychoric correlation may fail with the message 'Error in if (rho == 0) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed' (fixed in 0.5-10)
  - estimator="ULS" does not work if only sample statistics are provided
  - if the ordered= argument contains a single variable only, it fails
  - the anova() function may fail for scaled difference tests if the (full) M1 model contains parameters that are not listed in the parameterTable of (restricted) M0 model (workaround: use anova(fit1, fit2, SB.classic=TRUE)
